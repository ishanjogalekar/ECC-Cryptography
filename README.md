# ECC Cryptography using Java
**Comparison between RSA , DSA and ECC based Cryptography**
*Used Crypto alogs -*
### 1. :snowflake: [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) - One of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on  the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem.
### 2. :atom: [DSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm) - It is used for digital signature and its verification and based on mathematical concept of modular exponentiation and discrete logarithm.  
### 3. :star2: [ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) - Public-key cryptosystems based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields.
